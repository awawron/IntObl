After reading tons of people complaining about tanks being helpless against cas I would like to share my tips as a player who uses cas a lot,"If enemy has air superiority
You can do several things.  
1. Avoids stationary positions, if you sit in one spot too long sniping in a large tank you will attract aircraft for two reasons
a. Allied factions struggle to take out heavy snipers and rely on cas to stop them
b.it‚Äôs a easy to locate and hit target that is a priority to any aircraft
2. Anti aircraft work
3. Vertical awareness in addition to horizontal awareness keep an eye on what‚Äôs going on overhead aircraft that intend to attack you are fairly obvious and changing course as they commit to a attack is a ideal solution. Even in top tier where they likely already dropped
4. protect your SPAA and anti air missile vehicles (at top teir these things are extremely op and can kill players with little to no effort) 

5.coordinate with friendly fighter craft  use the revolutionary C.H.A.T feature (communicating.hostiles.attracts.teamates) to inform friendly aircraft and spaa that ground attack craft are operating in a certain area

6. Engage in air to air combat for your teamates.

7. Prefer faster smaller vehicles when enemy aircraft are dominant.

8. Stick to cover and near large objects (pilots vision is limited in the short time he is in the proper angle to locate you a larger object can stand out in his vision and distract from smaller objects. On top of that trees and buildings can obstruct proper deployment of munitions onto your vehicles.)

9. Get gud",z9xszy,2920,544,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warthunder/comments/z9xszy/after_reading_tons_of_people_complaining_about/
